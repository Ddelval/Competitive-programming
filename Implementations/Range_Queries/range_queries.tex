\chapter{Range queries}

\section{Types of range queries}
Depending on the type of function whose value we have to calculate over
the given range:
\begin{itemize}
		\item \textit{Idempotent functions}. These functions fulfill the 
				following condition $f(f(x))=f(x)$. For instance, the maximum
				and minimum of a list of values are idempotent. 
				Furthermore, since the GCD and LCM can be seen as 
				the \say{maximum} and the \say{minimum} of the exponents in the
				prime factorization, it is only natural that they fulfill the same 
				property.

				The most important property of these functions for range queries
				is that we can evaluate the elements of the range several times 
				without affecting the result. For instance:
				\[
						\min(a_l,\dots ,a_r)= \min \left (
								\min (a_l, \dots,  a_k), \min (a_{k},\dots, a_r)
						\right ) \quad l < k <r
				\]
				even though the union of the intervals includes $a_k$ twice.
				This is the property in which sparse tables are based.


		\item  \textit{Reversible functions}. Functions that have an inverse
				also have advantages in range queries. That is because we
				can easily remove elements from any range to obtain a smaller
				one. In these cases we can obtain the final range by adding
				and subtracting ranges that have been precalculated.

				For instance, the addition, subtraction and xor operations have 
				an inverse (subtraction, addition and xor respectively). 

\end{itemize}

\newpage
Many problems can be transformed into a range query easily.

\subsection{LCA using RMQ}
To use this algorithm we need a rooted tree with undirected edges where the 
nodes are labeled in a particular order. Specifically, nodes at a greater
depth have to be labeled with a greater value. Furthermore, the algorithm
could be extended to process a forest (instead of a single tree) but 
this version cannot process forests.

We can traverse the tree using dfs and store in an array each node that we 
encounter. If we also keep track of the time at which each node was found
for the first time, the LCA can be converted into calculating the minimum
in an array of length $E+V$.

\begin{figure}[h!]
		\centering
		\resizebox{70 mm}{!}{\subimport{figures/}{LCA_to_RMQ.pdf_tex}}
\end{figure}
After running a DFS in the tree, we would get the following array of 
values and discovery times:
\begin{figure}[h!]
		\centering
		\begin{subfigure}{0.55\textwidth}
		\centering
\begin{tikzpicture}
		\draw (-6,0) pic[]{array_rep={}{1, 2, 4, 
				2, 5, 2, 1, 3, 6, 8, 6, 3, 7, 3, 1}};
\end{tikzpicture}
		\end{subfigure}
		\begin{subfigure}{0.4\textwidth}
		\centering
		\scalebox{0.9}{
				\begin{tabular}{c|c||c|c}
						\footnotesize{ \textbf{Node}} & \footnotesize{\textbf{Time}}&
						\footnotesize{\textbf{Node}} & \footnotesize{\textbf{Time}}\\
						\hline \hline
						1 & 0 &5 & 4\\
						2 & 1 &6 & 8\\
						3 & 7 &7 & 12\\
						4 & 2 &8 & 9\\
				\end{tabular}
		}
		\end{subfigure}

\end{figure}

Now if we want to get the LCA between nodes 5 and 6, we have to obtain the minimum
value in the range [4, 8]. As we can see, the result is obviously 1.

If we compare this approach to binary lifting, we observe that we have a considerably
more expensive precalculation phase but, afterwards, answering any queries takes
constant time instead of logarithmic time. In particular, the complexities for this 
method are:
\begin{itemize}
		\setlength{\itemsep}{1pt}
		\item Precomputate the values: $\mathcal{O}(E\log(E))$
		\item Calculate the LCA of a node: $\mathcal{O}(1)$
		\item Memory usage: $\mathcal{O}(E\log(E))$
\end{itemize}
Where $E=\text{edges}$.

\section{Sparse table}
The sparse table is a data structure that calculates the value of 
a function over a range of immutable elements with the following complexity:
\begin{itemize}
		\setlength{\itemsep}{2 pt}
		\item \tbf{$\mathcal O(n\log n)$} to build the data structure
		\item \tbf{$\mathcal O(1)$} to answer queries on a range. 
		\item \tbf{$\mathcal O(n\log n)$} memory
\end{itemize}
Furthermore, the function must be \textbf{idempotent}. This allows the use of
overlapped intervals in the calculations. A Sparse Table can be adapted to 
answer queries with more general functions. However, it would lose the constant
time query capabilities and would be no more efficient than a segment tree or a BIT.


On the other hand, the data structure is rather simple, and its implementation 
is considerable shorter than any other alternatives. 

The table consists of $\log n$ rows. Each one of them contains the value of the
function in intervals of length $2^j$ where $j$ is the row index. In particular,
table$[j][i]=f([i,i+2^j])$, where $f(I)$ is the value of $f$ over all the 
elements in $I$.

To construct the table we take advantage of the fact that the intervals of each
row are the exact union of two intervals of the previous row. Finally,
during the look-up process, to obtain the 
logarithm of each value, we can calculate the most significant bit that is set 
using \mintinline{cpp}{__builtin_clz()}.

\newpage
\subsection{Example}
One of the best applications of the sparse table is to calculate the maximum of 
any range in an array of elements. The following illustration displays all the 
intervals that will be included in the sparse table. To avoid intersections, 
intervals that belong to the same level of the table may be displayed above 
or below each other.

In each interval, we can see both the index (top left corner) and the value of
the maximum in that interval. It can also be seen that all intervals can 
be calculated using the values obtained in the previous level.

Now, if we want to calculate the maximum between indices 2 and 7 we will:
\begin{enumerate}
		\setlength{\itemsep}{2pt}
		\item Calculate the length of the interval. In this case, $7-2+1=6$
		\item Calculate the maximum value of $k$  such that $2^k<6$. In this
				case, $k=2$.
		\item Pick the interval that starts on 2 with length $2^k=4$ and the
				interval that starts on $7-2^k+1$ with the same length. 
				That is to say, intervals 2 and 4 from level 2 of the table.

				As we can see these intervals cover the entire range, albeit 
				they overlap. However, the overlap does not affect the result
				of the maximum.
		\item Take the maximum between the values of the two intervals 
				selected: $\max(8,6)=8$
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Sparse Table {\scriptsize(sort of)} with $\mathcal{O}(n)$ memory}

This variant of the sparse table is only capable of answering very
specific queries. In particular, the operation must meet the following
constraints:
\begin{itemize}
		\setlength{\itemsep}{2pt}
		\item It is idempotent (as in a normal Sparse Table)
		\item The result of the operation over a range is an element
				in that range
\end{itemize}
Therefore, this data structure will mostly only be used for querying the
maximum or the minimum over a range. On the other hand, we obtain a data 
structure that uses significantly less memory and can be built in
considerably less time, albeit with slower queries.
\subsection*{Explanation}
With that goal in mind, we will group the elements of the array in blocks.
These blocks should be of size $\log (n)$. However, since $n$ will never
be larger than $2^{30}$, we can set their size to 30. Now  we will build 
two data structures:
\begin{itemize}
		\setlength{\itemsep}{2pt}
		\item A Sparse Table where each element is a block of the array. 
				In order to simplify this task, in the Sparse Table we will
				store the index of the result of applying the operation to the 
				range instead of the result itself. 

				Therefore, the elements in the first row of the table will be the 
				index of the result of applying the operation to each block of the array while
				the elements in the following layers will represent applying the
				operation to 2, 4, 8 \dots blocks.

		\item A structure that stores the result for every range of 30 contiguous 
				elements in the array.
\end{itemize}

If we have these two data structures we can split the (large) query into three subqueries
that will most likely overlap. In particular, we will split the range $[l, r]$ into:
\begin{itemize}
		\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
		\item A range of size 30 starting at $l$.
		\item The blocks that are fully contained within the interval.
		\item A range of size 30 that ends at $r$.
\end{itemize}
The middle range will be processed using the Sparse Table of blocks while the other 
two must be calculated using the new data structure.

\begin{figure}[h!]
		\centering
		\resizebox{0.75\textwidth}{!}{\subimport{figures/}{Optimized_Sparse.pdf_tex}}
\end{figure}
\newpage
In order to answer the small queries, we will use a bitmask for every position. That
is to say, a vector of $n$ integers where each of them is a bitmask for that position.
Let's look at the bitmask of position $r$. The bit $r-k, \ (k<30)$ will 
be one iff that element is the result in the range $[r-k, r]$.  
For instance, at position $6$ of this example array the bitmask would be:
\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\begin{tikzpicture}
		\begin{scope}[]
				\foreach \m/\c/ \v in{
						0/1/1,
						1/4/0,
						2/2/1,
						3/6/0,
						4/7/0,
						5/4/1,
						6/5/1
				}{
				\pgfmathtruncatemacro{\om}{\m}
				\pgfmathsetmacro{\sm}{0.5*\m}
				\pgfmathsetmacro{\em}{0.5+\sm}
				\node[draw, fit={(\sm,0)(\em,0.5)}, inner sep = 0 pt, label = center: \c](A){};
				\node[fit={(\sm,0.6)(\em,0.8)}, inner sep = 0 pt, label = center: \scalebox{0.7}{\om}](A){};
				\node[fit={(\sm,-1)(\em,0)}, inner sep = 0 pt, label = center: \scalebox{0.9}{\v}](A){};
				}
		\end{scope}
		\node[anchor=east] (a) at (-0.5,0.25){\texttt{array:}};
		\node[anchor=east] (a) at (-0.5,-0.5){\texttt{mask:}};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{figure}
This bitmask approach is particularly useful because the vector of bitmasks can be built in linear time. 
If we look at the code below (\texttt{build\_mask()}), the \texttt{while} loop 
will only be executed at most once for every element while 
the \texttt{for} loop iterates through all elements exactly once.

\cppcode[firstline=20]{code/Linear_RMQ.cpp}




\newpage
\section{Fenwick tree (BIT)}
A Fenwick tree or binary indexed tree (BIT) can be used to calculate the value
of a \textbf{reversible} function $F$ over a range of values. Given an array of elements
$A$ of size $N$:
\begin{itemize}
		\setlength{\itemsep}{2pt}
		\item Given a range $[l,r]$, the value $F(a_l,\dots, a_r)$ can be calculated
				in \tbf{$\mathcal{O}(\log n)$}
		\item Updating one of the values of the array takes \tbf{$\mathcal{O}(\log n)$}
		\item Requires the same amout of memory as the array $A$
\end{itemize}
To do so, we create a new array \texttt{ft} where each element represents
the value of the function over a particular range. Let LSOne($i$) be the 
result of setting to 0 all bits of $i$ except for the least significant one.
For instance, LSOne$(0110)=0010$. Then, the $i$-th element of \texttt{ft} 
contains the value $F(a_{i-\text{LSOne}(i)+1},\dots, a_{i})$. 

In most cases, $F$ will be the sum of all elements $F(a_l,\dots, a_r)=\sum_l^r{a_i}$.
In that case, \text{ft[i]} contains the sum of all the elements from 
position $i-\text{LSOne}(i)$ (excluded) to position $i$ (included).


It is also important to note that this BIT is \textbf{1-indexed interally} to simplify slightly 
the implementation. However, the interface automatically subtracts one to all index parameters
given.
\subsection*{Range Update and Point Query}
The standard BIT allows point update and range query. Using a difference array, we can 
transform them into range update and point query. If $B$ is the difference array
of $A$, the elements of $B$ are defined as:  $b_i=a_i- a_{i-1}$ and $b_1=a_1$.
Therefore:
\begin{itemize}
		\setlength{\itemsep}{2pt}
		\item $\sum_{1}^i b_j=a_i$, converting the range query into 
				a point query
		\item To update the elements in the range $[l,r]$ by $d$, we can add
				$d$ to the $l$-th element and subtract $d$ from the $r$-th element.
				In doing so, queries that reach until a point
				between $l$ and $r$ will be increased by $d$ but queries that reach 
				further will not be affected.
				Therefore, we have converted two point updates into a range update.

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Example}
For instance, if we use the addition operation, array on the left would be processed
into the BIT tree displayed on the right. Each box under the BIT tree represents
the elements that are added to get the value of that position.

\section{Segment Trees}
A Segment Tree is a data structure that allows answering range queries 
over a range effectively while permitting modifications to
be performed to the elements in the array. 
Furthermore, a Segment Tree can answer many types of queries.
In fact, we only need that the operation satisfies the following property:
\begin{center}
		\itshape
		The value of a range can be calculated from the values of two
		disjoint subranges whose union is the entire range.
\end{center}
Most common operations such as the maximum, the minimum or the gcd
all fulfill this property.  For instance, in the case of the sum:
\[
		i<k<j \implies \mathrm{sum}(a_i, \dots, a_j) = 
		\mathrm{sum}(a_i, \dots, a_k)+
		\mathrm{sum}(a_{k+1}, \dots, a_j)
\]
However, sometimes it may be necessary to store additional information in 
the vertices of the Segment Tree to be able to construct the solution
from the data from the two subranges.
The time complexities are the following:
\begin{itemize}
		\boldmath
		\item Build time: $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$ 
		\item Query: $\mathcal{O}( \log n)$
		\item Update $\mathcal{O}( \log n)$
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{Example problem}
We are given a string $s$ consisting only of 0s and 1s. We must be able
to perform the following types of queries:
\begin{itemize}
		\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
		\item Calculate the length of the maximum continuous substring of 1s
				inside a given interval
		\item Flip all numbers in an interval. That is to say, all 1s turn
				into 0s and the other way around.
\end{itemize}
In this case, we need to use lazy propagation and store the following information
in each node:
\begin{minted}{cpp}
struct node{
	int prefix1s, sufix1s, prefix0s, sufix1s;
	int longestInterval0, longestInterval1;
	int lazyFlip;
};
\end{minted}
Storing the prefix and suffix information allows us to calculate the value of
intervals that begin in the elements corresponding to the left child and
end in elements that correspond to the right child. Therefore, we will be able 
to calculate the answer of each node looking only at their children.

\newpage
\subsection{Lazy propagation}
Lazy propagation enables the Segment Tree to perform updates over a range 
in logarithmic time. However, in order to be able to use this technique we
need the following property:
\begin{center}
\itshape
Two updates that affect the same node can be merged into a single update 
\end{center}
As with the basic property of Segment Trees, this one also holds true for
the most common operations. In fact, as long as there is only one type of
update query, it will generally be true.
However, in scenarios where different updates may be requested, it is critical
that they can be merged. 
\subsubsection*{Example}
Problem \texttt{UVa-11402} boils down to performing the following three
operations over ranges of a binary string and then counting the number 
of 1s in any range.  Otherwise, the number of nodes modified by a single
query would be $\mathcal{O}(n)$, which would ruin the logarithmic time
complexity.
\begin{enumerate}
		\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
		\item Set all positions in the range to 1
		\item Set all positions in the range to 0
		\item Flip all positions in the range 
\end{enumerate}
In this case, when propagate the lazy value stored in a node to their 
children, we must \say{merge} it with the lazy value already stored
in the children. For instance:
\begin{center}
\texttt{lazy[node] = 1 \& lazy[child] = 2 $\implies$ 
lazy[child] = 1} 
\end{center}
\subsubsection*{Lazy lazy propagation}
In some cases, we can avoid the push down operation. Instead,
we can store the lazy values in the nodes that they are
stored into during the usual update procedure and collect
the values on the way up during the query process. For instance,
to implement range updates and point queries, in an initially
empty array, we might use the following code:
\cppcode[firstline=28, lastline=51]{code/LazyLazy.cpp}
However, this technique can only be used in very simple cases
as we can very easily run into timing issues when the 
effect of the queries depends on the previous queries.

Nevertheless, when it can be used, it reduces a lot of the overhead
associated with range queries in the segment tree.


\subsection{Range update and query}
Even though the implementation of a Segment Tree highly depends
on the nature of the update queries, the following implementation
should at least serve as a starting point in many situations.

The template parameters have the following meaning:
\begin{itemize}
		\item \texttt{T}. Type of the elements that are stored
				in every node. Note that this could be a structure
				with many fields as we saw in the first example
				problem of this section.

		It is also important to note that if a \texttt{struct} is
		used, an equality operator must be defined.
		\item \texttt{merge}. This function takes the values
				of the children of a given node and returns the
				value of that node.

				\textbf{Note that in this implementation, this same function
				is used to merge the propagation values.} This will work
				for simple problems, but more complex ones will need a separate
				function to merge these.
		\item \texttt{initialize}. This function takes the position of
				the element and returns the initial value of that element.
				In most cases, it will simply contain an array look-up. However,
				it can also initialize all positions to a constant value or to
				any value that can be calculated from the position.
		\item \texttt{neutral}. This is a \texttt{constexpr} value that stores
				an element that will be ignored by the merge function. For instance,
				if the operation was the sum, this value would be 0 and if the 
				operation was the minimum, this value could be $+\infty$. 
\end{itemize}
\cppcode[firstline=20,]{code/SegmentTree.cpp}
\newpage
\subsection{Persistent segment trees}
In some scenarios it is useful to be able to execute a query or an update on a
previous state of the segment tree. To implement this feature in our segment
tree, we could create a new segment tree every time that we execute an update.
However, if we were to answer $q$ queries with this approach, the complexity 
be $\mathcal{O}(q \, n\log n)$. However, by using persistent segment trees,
we can bring the complexity down to $\mathcal{O}(q\log n)$ while having full 
access to all previous states of the segment tree.

In order to do so, we have to observe that each query will at most modify 
$\log n$ nodes. Therefore, we can create new versions for those nodes
while keeping the rest of the nodes. The simplest way to implement this concept
is with a pointer-based implementation of the segment tree.

\subsubsection{Implementation}
The following implementation calculates range sums and allows point updates.
The first element of the implementation is the \texttt{node} structure.
This represents a single node in the persistent segment tree and can belong
to different versions of the segment tree. Therefore, we will allocate it
in the heap and leave it there for all versions to access.
\cppcode[firstline=20,lastline =27]{code/PersistentSegTree.cpp}

The rest of the implementation can be split into two parts. The first one is
the \say{private} one, which deals with the nodes itself while the second
part is the interface that should be used to interact with the segment
tree. Nevertheless, no members are private since in some scenarios 
(walking down the tree) we might need to access the internal members.

Regarding the private section, we have three functions:
\begin{itemize}
		\item \texttt{build} creates a segment tree initialized to 0
				and returns a pointer to the root node
		\item \texttt{\_query} is completely analogous to the normal query
				function in a segment tree
		\item \texttt{\_update} performs the same action as the 
				\say{traditional} update function. However, it returns 
				a pointer to the new node that was created with the updated
				value. We can  see in line 63 how the newly created nodes
				partially point to older nodes in the segment trees (those
				whose value was not modified by the query) 
\end{itemize}

\cppcode[firstline=29,lastline =69]{code/PersistentSegTree.cpp}
\newpage
Finally, the interface of the persistent segment tree only has two operations,
it can either query a range or perform an update, which would return a
new \texttt{PersistentSegTree}.
In both cases, the functions only set the right internal variables and call the
private ones. 

It is important to remember the declaration on line 87 of the static variables
used internally by the segment tree. These must be declared outside the 
class.
\cppcode[firstline=73,lastline =89]{code/PersistentSegTree.cpp}

\subsubsection{Example}
As an example, in problem \texttt{SPOJ-KQUERY}, the creation of the versions 
of the segment tree is performed as follows:
\begin{minted}{cpp}
vector<PersistSegTree> versions;
versions.push_back(PersistSegTree(n));
for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
	int value = getCompressed[originalData[i]];
	versions.push_back(versions.back().update(value, 1));
}
\end{minted}
And, afterwards, we can query a specific version $i$ of the segment tree 
between $a$ and $b$ by using:
\begin{minted}{cpp}
int ans = versions[i].query(a,b);
\end{minted}
\newpage
\subsubsection{Example}
Let us consider how the range sum persistent segment tree would behave 
during some queries.
In this example, we will start by constructing a persistent segment
tree over an array \\ \texttt{a = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]}. This will result on
the segment tree in black.
Now, we will perform the following queries:
\begin{itemize}
		\item \textit{Add 1 to the first position}. To do so, we have to
				change all ancestors of the first leaf. This process will
				lead to the segment tree in blue. The key observation here is
				the fact that we have only added 4 blue nodes and some of them
				are connected to black nodes. In doing so, we can reuse nodes 
				that have not been modified.
		\item \textit{Add 1 to the second position}. This will result in the
				segment tree in green, which has nodes connected to both black 
				and green node. Again, this enables us to change only
				$\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ nodes in each iteration.

\end{itemize}
\begin{figure}[h!]

		\resizebox{90 mm}{!}{\subimport{figures/}{persegtree.pdf_tex}}
\end{figure}
As we can see, if we keep track of the roots that are created in each update,
we can access any version of the segment tree.
\newpage
\subsubsection{Number of elements less or equal than $k$ in a range}
An example of this problem is \texttt{SPOJ-KQUERY}
In order to solve this problem we will build a histogram of every prefix of
the array. Given the example array \texttt{a}, the histograms of the different
prefixes are the rows of the table.
\begin{figure}[h!]
		\centering
		\begin{subfigure}[t]{0.4\textwidth}
		\begin{center}
		\begin{tikzpicture}
				\draw (-6,0) pic[]{array_rep={a =}{5,1,2,5,2,3}};
		\end{tikzpicture}
		\end{center}
		\end{subfigure}
		\begin{subfigure}[t]{0.55\textwidth}
		\begin{center}
				\begin{tabular}{c|ccccc}
						Length & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\ \hline
							 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
							 2 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
							 3 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
							 4 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 2 \\
							 5 & 1 & 2 & 0 & 0 & 2 \\
							 6 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 0 & 2 \\
				\end{tabular}
		\end{center}
		\end{subfigure}
\end{figure}
Now, we can build a persistent segment tree for those histograms. The first
version of the segment tree will contain the histogram of the empty
prefix, the second version will contain the histogram of the prefix of length
one\ldots. Since each histogram only differs from the previous one in one value,
the persistent segment tree will only have $n+1$ version. To create these 
versions, we could execute:
\begin{minted}{cpp}
vector<PersistSegTree> versions;
versions.push_back(PersistSegTree(n)); // Empty histogram
for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i){
	versions.push_back(versions.back().update(a[i], 1));
}
\end{minted}

Now, if we are given a range $[l,r]$ (1-indexed) and asked to return the number
of elements
less or equal to $k$ in that range, we can calculate it in the following way:
\begin{minted}{cpp}
int ans = versions[l].query(0,k) - versions[r-1].query(0,k);
\end{minted}
\subsubsection{Find the $k$-th smallest element in a range (Slow)}
Create a segment tree of size $n$ and iterate through the elements in the 
array sorted by value. At each iteration, set the positions corresponding 
to that element to 1. 

Then, when asked a query in a range we just have to know which is the first
version that has at least $k$ positions set to 1 in that range. 
This can easily be accomplished with a binary search over the segment trees. 
However, this binary search introduces another log factor in the complexity,
which gives the solution an $\mathcal{O}(q\log^2n)$ time complexity to answer
$q$ queries.
\newpage
\subsubsection{Find the $k$-th smallest element in a range (Fast)}
Now we will solve the same problem but with a time complexity of 
$\mathcal{O}(q\log n)$. To do so, we will use a similar approach as in 
the first application of the persistent segment tree and build a histogram 
for every prefix. 
When we get a query for the range $[l,r]$, we can walk down the segment tree
. In each node, we will check whether
the answer is in the left or the right child. There are two options:
\begin{itemize}
		\item The sum of the left child is greater or equal to the target value.
				In this case, the answer is one of the indices of the left
				child since we are looking for the first index whose sum is
				at least $k$.
		\item The sum of the left child is less than the target value. Then 
				the solution is one of the indices of the right child.
				However, before continuing the search, we have to update the 
				target value and subtract from it the sum of the left child.
				This is because once we descend to the right subtree, the nodes
				that we will encounter only contain the sum up to the end of
				the right subtree.
\end{itemize}
Finally, we have to take into account that we do not have a specific segment
tree for the range $[l,r]$ but it is easy to see that the values in this 
segment tree would be the difference between the two segment trees in the 
edges of the range. Therefore, to calculate the answer:
\cppcode[firstline=90 ,lastline=103]{code/PersistentSegTree.cpp}
\begin{minted}{cpp}
// In main():
int res = findKth(histograms[l-1].head, histograms[r].head, 0, size - 1, k);
\end{minted}
An example of this problem is \texttt{SPOJ-MKTHNUM}
