This repository mainly consists of the solutions that 
I have submitted to several online judges. Feel
free to take a look at my approach to these problems.

If you have any questions about my approach to them,
suggestions or just want to discuss any particular problem,
you can contact me at delvaldavid1@gmail.com.

There is also a list of algorithms that I started recently
(`Implementations/implementations.pdf`). I haven't added many algorithms yet, but it will (hopefully) keep growing.
